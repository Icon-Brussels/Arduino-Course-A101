## Lesson 1

Topic: **Act and React**

Goal: Interact with the following sensors and actuators:
- LED
- Closing a circuit
- RGB LED
- Photoresistor
- Servomotor

Optional:
- Digital Humidity sensor

## Lesson 2

Topic: **Solder and assemble**

Goal: Learn soldering and circuit design

### Part 1: Solder

- solder a small circuit with LEDs and resistors
- connect it to an Arduino and create animations

### Part 2: Design

- analize and reproduce a complex circuit
- control a high power circuit (12V) with three IRF540 mostfets
- draw a schematic of the circuit to help you reproduce it
- dimm a LED strip from an Arduino
